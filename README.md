# SIH Drowning Dataset

Loss of lives due to drowning is being reported at popular Sea shores/beaches which need to be curtailed through the application of jelly bots. On alerting by distress visuals, jelly bots will swam/travel to the zone and target will get entrapped by soft tentacles to bring to the safety following the programmed path.
